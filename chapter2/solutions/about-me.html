    About Me
    Using all of the knowledge you’ve learned so far, 
    create an HTML webpage called About Me. 
    Use a heading and paragraph tag to write 
    a short paragraph about yourself and your life. 
    Use at least 3 text formatting tags in the paragraph.

    Note: This is a sample solution; yours should
    look different.

        <p>
            My name is Tony Stark. I'm a self-proclaimed 
            billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist.
            You may have watched one of the movies about my
            superhero life called <i>Iron Man</i>. Personally,
            I don't think it captured the reality of my life,
            but it definitely <strong>made me look cool</strong>.
            <br>
            Anyway, I spent a good chunk of my life fighting
            big bad guys as a member of the Avengers. Unfortunately,
            <del>I recently found out that I'm a fictional character</del>,
            so that definitely puts a damper on things...
